# Lightning
Spigot plugin that makes lightnings more dangerous.

Where lightning ball strikes there explodes like a half of a creeper. If hits water or metal block like iron, gold or copper block (and all other copper blocks) doesn't explode. Also doesn't explode when you call litghning ball with trident.
